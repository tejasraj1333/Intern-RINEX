## Machine Learning Projects & Learning

During my Machine Learning journey, I focused on building a **strong foundation** in core concepts, including:

- **Mathematics for ML**: Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics, and Optimization techniques.  
- **Python Programming**: Data structures, control flows, functions, and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  
- **Data Manipulation & Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and exploring datasets to prepare them for ML models.

### Projects

1. **Weather Classification**
   - **Objective**: Predict weather conditions based on historical weather data.  
   - **Techniques Used**: Decision Trees for classification.  
   - **Outcome**: Achieved **90.05% accuracy**, demonstrating effective model training and feature selection.

2. **Sales Advertising Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Analyze real-time sales data to understand the impact of advertising on sales performance.  
   - **Techniques Used**: Data analysis with Pandas, visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn.  
   - **Outcome**: Generated actionable insights for sales and marketing strategies, highlighting trends and patterns in advertising effectiveness.

These projects helped me **apply theoretical knowledge** to practical problems, strengthen my data manipulation skills, and gain experience with **building and evaluating ML models**.
